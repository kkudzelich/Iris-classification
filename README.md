# Iris-classification
The Iris dataset consists of 50 samples from each of 3 species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. The model that can classify the different species of the Iris flower was developed.
