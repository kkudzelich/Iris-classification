# Iris-classification
The Iris dataset consists of 50 samples from each of 3 species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

The project includes a comprehensive analysis of the Iris dataset through extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and the application of various Machine Learning models to accurately classify Iris species based on their sepal and petal measurements.
